# Quote-Generator
This amazing quote generator is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies, By connecting to an API for the quotes information. In this application, we have amazing features i.e
“get quote” button so when we click on that button, we can get the quotes from the API.
We can copy the quote that has been generated using the copy functionality.
The quotes that have been generated can also be listened to using the volume button functionality.
When we click on the button “get quote”. In the background, a loading will happen after that; the quote will be generated.
